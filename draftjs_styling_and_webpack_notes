webpack
why do you need webpack for react?
-react needs JSX but javascript doesnt understand JSX so babel does this, webpack runs babel for us
- webpack allows us to use require in front end code, browser doesnt understand require, webpack does

//WEBPACK CONFIG FILE
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
  entry: './reactApp/app.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/build',
    filename: 'app.bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/, //anything thats not included in node modules use the use block below
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['react', 'es2015']
          }
        }
    },
     { test: /\.s?css$/,
     loader: 'style-loader!css-loader' }, //loader: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
    ]
  },
  stats: {
    colors: true
  },
  devtool: 'source-map'
};
